Ok, so in coding professionally for 4 years I feel that making software on a whim and without planning just doesn't yield the results I've intended on reaching. That being said I'm taking to blogging my daily learnings and doings in hoping to enforce good habits and allow myself to keep record of challenges and triumphs.

Anyhow, to get things started it's maybe worth discussing the plans for what I hope to get done with the remainder of this year. These are:

- Finish the "Rust Programming Language" book
- Upload a cargo library and get **100** downloads on it
- Make a blog and update it daily
- Learn React (From Learning React book)
- Learn Github Actions CI/CD (read the docs + use in example application)
- Finish updating the tumor-area-calcalator application that I am helping my oncology homies with
- Learn Solana (read the docs + make a dApp)

Oh, also for 2023 these are the proposed goals:

- Submit a Hacker101 bug
- Make fireworks simulator
- Finish 360 LeetCode problems (2 a day) in Rust
